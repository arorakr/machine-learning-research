## Classification

- [ ] How the ratio between parameters and samples influence the model fitting?
  - The higher the ratio of parameters p to number of samples n, the more we expect this overfitting to play a role
  - Overfitting: The model can become overly complex, capturing noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to poor generalization to new, unseen data.
