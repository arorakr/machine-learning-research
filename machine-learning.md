## Model Performance

- Prefer choosing models that have good cross-validation and test accuracy
  - Good Cross-Validation Accuracy: a good cross-validation accuracy indicates good stability and generalization across different subsets of data
  - Good Test Accuracy: the model generalizes well on unseen data
