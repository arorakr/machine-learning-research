# Sybil: A Validated Deep Learning Model to Predict Future Lung Cancer Risk From a Single Low-Dose Chest Computed Tomography

## Benefits

- Sybil can predict future lung cancer risk from a single LDCT scan with a high degree of accuracy (Area Under the Curve or AUC) in the range of 0.86 to 0.94 for predicting cancer within one year and 0.74 to 0.81 for prediction within six years in various validation datasets. This suggests it could potentially outperform traditional risk assessment models that rely on clinical factors alone.
- Provide a personalized risk score based on the LDCT image, Sybil could help clinicians determine the optimal screening intervals for individual patients. Those at lower risk might safely extend their screening intervals, while those at higher risk could be monitored more closely. This could lead to more efficient and cost-effective screening programs.
- Sybil's ability to predict risk from the LDCT image itself, without relying on extensive clinical data or radiologist annotations, could potentially expand lung cancer screening to individuals who may not meet current high-risk criteria (e.g., never-smokers who are increasingly being diagnosed with lung cancer).
- Reduced False Positives: This could lead to fewer unnecessary follow-up procedures (like biopsies) and reduce patient anxiety.
- It can learn complex patterns and subtle features in the LDCT images that might not be visible to the human eye
- Sybil is designed to analyze LDCT scans as they become available without requiring additional input from radiologists or manual annotations
