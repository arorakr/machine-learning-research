# Mathematics for Machine Learning

## Mathematical Foundation

### Introduction

- Concepts of machine learning
  - We represent data as vectors
  - We chose an appropriate model, either using the probabilistic or optimization view
  - We learn from available data by using numerical optimization methods with the aim that the model performs well on data ot used for training

### Linear algebra

- Algebra: a set of rules to manipulate a set of objects (symbols)
- Linear Algebra: the study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors
