# Understanding Deep Learning

## What's a Neural Network?

- For a house price prediction, we want to predict the price of a house based on their sizes
  - The size is the `x` (`x` could also be a combination of size, #bedrooms, zip code (postal code), wealth)
    - The family size, walkability, and school quality will be figure out by the neural network (they are also called `hidden units`)
    - size/#bedrooms: family size
    - zip code: walkability
    - zip code/wealth: school quality
  - The price is the `y`
  - The circle in between is a "neuron" and it implements a function that takes the input (size), compute its linear function, takes a max of zero, and output the estimated price
