# Statistical Learning

- We have `X` and Y as variables, `X` as a predictor variable and `Y` as a output value
  - e.g. With the increase of number of years of education (`X`), the income (`Y`) also increases
  - The function `f` is unknown and statistical learning refers to a set of approaches for estimating `f`
- There are two main reasons that we may wish to estimate `f`: prediction and inference.
