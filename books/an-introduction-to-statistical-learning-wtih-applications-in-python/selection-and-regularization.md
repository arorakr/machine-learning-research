# Linear Model Selection and Regularization

Methods to improve the model's performance:

- **Subset Selection**: using a subset of the original variables (Best Subset Selection, Stepwise Selection, )
- **Shrinkage Methods**: shrinking their coefficients making it small or shrink all the way to zero (Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression)
- **Dimension Reduction Methods**: transforming and reducing predictors
