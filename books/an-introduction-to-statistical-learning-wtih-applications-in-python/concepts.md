# Concepts

## Statistics

- [ ] Standard Error (SE)
  - How to interpret this concept
  - What's the range of SE?
- [ ] z-statistic
  - How to interpret this concept
  - What's the range of z-statistic?
- [ ] p-value
  - How to interpret this concept
  - What's the range of p-value?
- [ ] collinearity
  - How to interpret this concept
- [ ] probability density
  - How to interpret this concept
    - it describes how the probability of a random variable is distributed over a range of values

## Linear Regression

- [ ] How a linear regression behaves
  - Illustration of a graph
  - Equation
  - What do we use to estimates the βs?

## Classification

- [ ] How a logistic regression behaves
  - Illustration of a graph
  - Equation
  - What do we use to estimates the βs?
- [ ] How a multiple logistic regression behaves
  - Illustration of a graph
  - Equation
  - What do we use to estimates the βs?
- [ ] How the ratio between parameters and samples influence the model fitting?
  - The higher the ratio of parameters p to number of samples n, the more we expect this overfitting to play a role
  - Overfitting: The model can become overly complex, capturing noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern. This leads to poor generalization to new, unseen data.
- [ ] What's covariance matrix?
  - A covariance matrix is a square matrix that contains the covariances between pairs of variables in a dataset.
  - Covariance measures the degree to which two variables change together
