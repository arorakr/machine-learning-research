# Linear Regression

- `intercept` and `slope` are parameters that define the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) in a linear equation
  - The intercept (often denoted as `β₀` or beta zero) is the value of the dependent variable (Y) when the independent variable (X) is zero. It represents the starting point of the regression line.
  - The slope (often denoted as `β₁` or beta one) represents the change in the dependent variable (Y) for a one-unit change in the independent variable (X). It indicates the steepness or slope of the regression line.
    - A positive slope indicates a positive relationship between X and Y, while a negative slope indicates a negative relationship.
