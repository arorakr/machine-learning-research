# Introduction

- A set of tools for understanding data
  - **Supervised**: a statistical model for pre- dicting, or estimating, an output based on one or more inputs.
  - **Unsupervised**: there are inputs but no supervising output; nevertheless we can learn relationships and struc- ture from such data.
- Regression: predicting a continuous or quantitative output value
  - e.g. Wage data: having wage, age, education level, and wage in years, we can predict a continuous output value, the wage for a specific example
- Classification: predict a non-numerical value, a categorical or qualitative output
  - e.g. Stock Market data: in a given day, the stock market performance will fall into the Up bucket or the Down bucket
