## Learning

- Learning is using past experience (not necessarily identical, or even very similar to new situations) for 2 things:
  - Changing the belief system or the world view
  - And then change the behavior
- The experience needs to be stored somewhere: we call it memory
  - Implicit memory: e.g. used for driving, we could not explicitly recall that memory
  - Explicit memory: can recall from memory
- The ambition: make computers learning in the same level we learn
  - 3 factors that built the current paradign for Machine Learning Algorithms
    - Technology advances: invention of computers > data abundance > data-driven computation
    - Knowledge: Principa Mathematica â€” generalize and formalize all the concepts behind mathematics > advances in logic, probability & neuroscience observations > research paper "A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity"
    - Optimization Algorithms
