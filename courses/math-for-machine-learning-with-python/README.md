# Math for Machine Learning with Python

## Algebra Fundamentals: Equations, Graphs, and Functions

Starting with an equation: `2x + 3 = 9` to find the the `x`. `x = 3`

```python
x = -41
x + 16 == -25 # True
```

Working with fractions

```python
x = 45
x / 3 + 1 == 16 # True
```

Variables in both sides

```python
x = 1.5
3 * x + 2 == 5 * x -1 # True
```
