# Machine Learning with Python

## Machine Learning Algorithms

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## Supervised Learning

- Learn input to output
- The model learns from being give the right answers (labels/value)
- Examples
  - Input: email -> output: spam? (spam filtering)
  - Input: audio -> output: transcript (speech recognition)
  - Input: english -> output: spanish (machine translation)
  - Input: image -> position of cars (self-driving car)
  - Input: image of phone -> defect? (visual detection)
- Regression
  - Housing price prediction: relationship between the size of the house and its price
