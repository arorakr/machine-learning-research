# Algorithms for DNA Sequencing

Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) in 2007 (second generation sequencing or massive parallel sequencing)

Get the sequence of DNA as a string getting the side of the double helix at a time

- double helix
- base pairs: A-T and C-G

DNA sequencing

- short snippets of DNA (reads): genome is orders of magnitude larger than these shorts snippets
  - chromosomes (1.000.000) vs reads (100)
- use massive parallel sequencing

## String definitions

- String `S` is a finite sequence of characters and { A, T, C, G }
- number of characters using `len(S)`
- empty string when `len(S)` is 0
