# Introduction to Genomics

- Genomics is the study of genomes

- DNA -> RNA -> Protein
- Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
- Codons are sequences of three consecutive nucleotides in an mRNA molecule
- Amino acid is encoded by a specific triplet of RNA nucleotides (a codon)
- Protein contain amino acids, so they are the building blocks of proteins
- Protein does all the functional work: metabolizing, digesting food
- We can generate the genome sequences but we need powerful computers to analyse the data
  - analysis: what are the mutations of this cell compare to the mutations of other cells for the same person?

## What's genomics?

The branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evolution and mapping of genomes.

- Structure: the sequences of A, C, G, T
- Function: what the DNA does - how the organs evolve
- Evolution: how the sequences change over evolutionary time

And the application of this knowledge in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, etc

## What Is Genomic Data Science?

- Process
  - Collect samples
  - Generate sequences: genome
  - Align to the reference genome (how they differ): how much of that gene was present
  - Preprocessing and normalization of the data: the sequencing machines make mistakes, the process of collecting data can introduce bias - apply computational and statistical methods to correct these kinds of systematic errors
  - Statistical and ML Models

## Molecular Biology

- Cell -> Nucleus -> Chromosome -> DNA
- Mitosis: DNA replication and cell division and multiplication
- DNA: four different nucleotides (molecules): AGCT
  - Adenine
  - Guanine
  - Cystosine
  - Thymine
  - A and G are similar and bigger
  - C and T are similar and smaller
- In RNA, T is replaced by U (uracil)
