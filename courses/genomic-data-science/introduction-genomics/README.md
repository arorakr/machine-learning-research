# Introduction to Genomics

- Genomics is the study of genomes

- DNA -> RNA -> Protein
- Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information from DNA to ribosomes
- Codons are sequences of three consecutive nucleotides in an mRNA molecule
- Amino acid is encoded by a specific triplet of RNA nucleotides (a codon)
- Protein contain amino acids, so they are the building blocks of proteins
- Protein does all the functional work: metabolizing, digesting food
- We can generate the genome sequences but we need powerful computers to analyse the data
  - analysis: what are the mutations of this cell compare to the mutations of other cells for the same person?

## What's genomics?

The branch of molecular biology concerned with the structure, function, evolution and mapping of genomes.

- Structure: the sequences of A, C, G, T
- Function: what the DNA does - how the organs evolve
- Evolution: how the sequences change over evolutionary time

And the application of this knowledge in medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, etc
