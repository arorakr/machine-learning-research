# AI for Medical Diagnosis

- [Data Exploration and Image Pre-processing](week1/data-exploration-and-image-pre-processing.ipynb)
- Challenges
  - Class Imbalance: there's not an equal number of examples between disease and non-disease in medical datasets
    - e.g. there are a lot more examples of "normal" compared to "mass" when it comes to x-rays for a healthy population
  - Multi-task
  - Dataset size
